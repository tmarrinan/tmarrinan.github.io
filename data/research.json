				"Research at Argonne National Laboratory focuses on executing analytic tasks at the same time as large-scale simulations are running on leadership computing resources. This research will enable researchers to view intermediate results and make real-time decisions, which can lead to a shortened time-to-discovery."

				"This research focuses on the next generation of scalable high-resolution collaboration spaces. SAGE2 is a multi-user operating environment that enhances co-located and remote collaboration by leveraging large-scale shared displays. The framework provides a ubiquitous computing platform to enable real-time data-conferencing using a Scalable Resolution Shared Display and networked personal devices, which are used for simultaneous multi-user interaction and document sharing. The shared display acts as a seamless ultra high-resolution windowing environment for documents and applications."

			"description": [
				"In this collaboration between the UIC Departments of BioEngineering, Neurosurgery, and Computer Science, I developed graphical stereoscopic visual applications for a standard single monitor as well as an ultra-high resolution multi-paneled platform. The visualization focused on viewing 4D (space and time) medical images from angiography, MRI, CT, and blood flow simulations for individual patients. These visualization tools have enhanced insight about the pathology of patients suffering from neurovascular disease, especially stroke. Improved preparation for surgical intervention is expected to empower surgeons to choose better medical treatment paths."

				"Three-dimensional data visualization was used to plot chromatography systems. This research led to more efficient identification of systems used for modifying the selectivity of the separation in complex chemical mixtures. This research soon evolved to require higher dimensional analysis. The research team used parallel coordinates and 3D glyph representation to enhance their prior work."

				"Volumetric visualization of data from the Hubble Space Telescope was used to help astronomers understand the kinematics of ionized gas in the nuclear regions of Seyfert galaxies, the most common active galactic nuclei. The goal was to compare spectroscopic-analysis results with the expectations from various gas flow models to determine the dominant acceleration mechanism. This research was done as part of DUSCI, the Drake Undergraduate Science Collaborative Institute."
